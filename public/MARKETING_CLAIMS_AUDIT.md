## Legal Compliance Notes

### Australian Consumer Law (ACL)
- Environmental claims must be truthful, accurate, and able to be substantiated
- Vague claims like "eco-friendly" without evidence can be misleading
- Quantified claims (percentages, savings) require documentation

### ACCC Eight Principles for Environmental Claims
1. ✅ Make accurate and truthful claims
2. ⚠️ Have evidence to back up claims (ROI needs work)
3. ⚠️ Be specific about benefits (progress metrics vague)
4. ✅ Don't exaggerate or overstate benefits
5. ✅ Use clear and easy-to-understand language
6. ✅ Explain how a product/service delivers environmental benefits
7. ⚠️ Avoid using absolute claims (99% accuracy)
8. ✅ Be transparent about limitations

## Transparency Best Practices Implemented

1. ✅ **Stripe Climate Dashboard Link** - Public verification of carbon removal
2. ✅ **Honest Stats** - "New Platform Launch" instead of inflated numbers
3. ✅ **Clear Pricing** - Transparent tier structure
4. ✅ **Standards Listed** - Specific compliance frameworks named
5. ✅ **14-Day Trial** - No hidden requirements
