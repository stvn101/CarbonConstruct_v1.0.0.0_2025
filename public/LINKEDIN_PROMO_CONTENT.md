### Post 1: Origin Story (Personal Brand Builder)
```
After 17 years in construction—from commercial towers to steel-framed partitions across SEQ, NSW, and Victoria—I got tired of the carbon reporting nightmare.

Spreadsheets. Manual lookups. Consultants charging $15K for data I could calculate myself.

So I built CarbonConstruct.

Not as a consultant.
Not as a software company.
As a builder who got fed up.

4,000+ verified Australian EPD materials.
NCC Section J compliance built-in.
Green Star and NABERS alignment.

Because the people building Australia's future shouldn't need a PhD to prove they're doing it sustainably.

🔧 Built by someone who's actually built things.

### Post 3: Problem/Solution (Value Proposition)
```
The carbon reporting problem in Australian construction:

❌ Generic international tools that don't understand our materials
❌ Consultants charging $10-20K per project
❌ Spreadsheets that take days to complete
❌ Data sources that aren't NABERS-verified

The solution I built:

✅ 4,000+ Australian EPD materials (NABERS 2025.1 verified)
✅ NCC 2024 Section J limits by building class
✅ Green Star credit alignment
✅ Reports in minutes, not days
✅ Your branding, not ours

I didn't build this for consultants.
I built it for builders, developers, and site managers who need to get compliant without getting a second mortgage.

Try it free. No credit card. No expiration.

### Post 4: IRL/Personal Brand (Authenticity)
```
Growing a moustache and building software.

2024 was about heads-down development.
2025 is about showing up.

Here's what I'm learning as a founder:

1. The product matters, but people buy from people
2. Construction industry trusts tradies over tech bros
3. LinkedIn IRL is making a comeback
4. Credibility comes from showing up, not just shipping

So here I am. Carpenter turned software founder.
Still learning. Still building.

If you're working on embodied carbon compliance in Australian construction, let's connect.

I built CarbonConstruct because I needed it.
Maybe you need it too.

### Post 5: Feature Highlight (White Label Focus)
```
Why white-labeling matters for builders:

When you submit a carbon report to:
- A certifier
- A developer client
- A council
- A Green Star assessor

They see YOUR logo. YOUR company. YOUR professionalism.

Not some third-party tool's branding plastered across your work.

CarbonConstruct Pro Yearly includes Level 1 White Label:
→ Your company logo on all PDF reports
→ Your contact details
→ Your brand colours (coming soon)

Because the report is YOUR deliverable.
The calculations are YOUR expertise.
The tool is just... a tool.

That's how it should be.

### Post 6: Urgency/Compliance (FOMO)
```
NCC 2024 is live.

Section J embodied carbon limits are now mandatory for:
- Class 2-9 buildings
- New builds over specific thresholds
- Certain alterations and additions

If you're still using:
- Consultants at $15K per report
- Generic international tools
- Excel spreadsheets with 2019 data

You're overpaying and under-delivering.

CarbonConstruct has:
✅ NCC 2024 building class limits built-in
✅ Automatic compliance checking
✅ Australian EPD materials (not UK or US defaults)
✅ Reports certifiers actually accept

The compliance clock is ticking.
